		<div id="aboutDiv">
			<h3>Swedish Massage</h3>
						<p> This is the most popular and commonly-known massage technique.<br>
						The therapist tends to use long, smooth and even strokes.Pressure tends to be light to medium; however,<br>
						it can be adjusted to your individual preference.  Massage techniques used in Swedish Massage might include circular<br>
						pressure applied by the hands and palms, firm kneading, percussion-like tapping, bending and stretching. Swedish Massage,<br>
						generally, promotes relaxation of the body and mind. </p>
		</div><br><br>

		<div id="aboutDiv">
			<h3>Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
						<p> Deep Tissue Massage  is especially helpful for aches and pains.<br>
						Similar techniques to Swedish Massage are utilized  but the movement is slower and the pressure might be deeper.<br>
						Deep tissue massage usually focuses on a specific problem, such as chronic muscle pain,<br>
						injury rehabilitation, and other conditions. </p>
		</div><br><br>

		<div id="aboutDiv">
			<h3>Trigger Point Massage</h3>
						<p> A trigger point is a tight area within muscle tissue that causes pain in other parts of the body.<br>
						For example, a trigger point in the back may reduce referral pain in the neck.<br>
						Trigger point therapy is designed to alleviate the source of pain through isolated pressure and release.
						</p>
		</div><br><br>

		<div id="aboutDiv">
			<h3>Hot Stone Massage</h3>
						<p> Hot Stone Massage Therapy  promotes deeper muscle relaxation through the placement of smooth,<br>
						water-heated stones at key points on the body. The direct heat of the stones relaxes muscles,<br>
						allowing the therapist access to deeper muscle layers. The hot stones have a sedative<br>
						effect that can relieve chronic pain, reduce stress and promote deep relaxation.
						</p>
		</div><br><br>

		<div" id="aboutDiv">
			<h3>Prenatal Massage</h3>
						<p> Massage therapy during pregnancy is a healthy way to reduce stress and promote overall wellness.<br>
						Massage relieves many of the normal discomforts experienced during pregnancy, such as backaches,<br>
						stiff neck, leg cramps, headaches and swelling.  Depending on where you are in your pregnancy,<br>
						your therapist may utilize such massage techniques as Swedish Massage or other techniques based on your needs and requests.
						</p>
		</div><br><br>

		<div id="aboutDiv">
			<h3>Aromatherapy</h3>
						<p> Aromatherapy uses essential oils extracted from herbs, flowers and fruits to naturally enhance the benefits of massage.<br>
						Aromatherapy blends can reduce aches and pains, reduce stress and anxiety, calm the mind or enliven the body.<br>
						Before each session begins, you can choose your essential oil to enhance your next massage session for only $5.
